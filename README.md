# async-api-comparison

The intention of this repository is to get a practical comparison of different Java and Scala frameworks of organizing collaborative work of multiple asynchronous tasks, like
* mapping task result 
* starting a new async tasks as the initial task is done
* zipping the results of 2 tasks
* etc.

The comparison is made by implementing the same scenario (is described below) and the comparison focuses only on the stylistic facet of the APIs, mainly concerning of the stylistic aspect of the frameworks (code readability, maintainability, verboseness, how error prone it is, etc.)
